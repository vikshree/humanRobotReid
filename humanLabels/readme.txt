NOTE:
Each line in the .csv file correspond to one participant.
Total 10 participants took the survey and provided attributes for 50 images.
The participants were allowed to look into each image for 15 seconds, which was
followed by the questionnaire.
The questionnaire includes only the "distinct" question classes i.e. Q1, Q2, Q3,
Q5, Q6, Q7, Q8, Q9, Q10, and Q13, which corresponds to a total of 34 attributes.
The responses in the .csv file are ordered as per the participant ID. For example,
Partcipant1 labels 001_viper, 002_viper, 003_viper, 004_viper and 005_viper
.
